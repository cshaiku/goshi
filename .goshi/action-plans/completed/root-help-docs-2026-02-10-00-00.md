# Root Goshi Command Help Documentation

**Created:** 2026-02-10-00-00  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Goal
Add missing Long description to the root `goshi` command to improve user discoverability and provide comprehensive guidance.

## Problem Identified
The root `goshi` command had only a Short description ("Goshi is a local-first protective CLI agent") but was missing a Long description. In contrast, all subcommands (fs, config, doctor, heal) had comprehensive Long help text. This made the root help less useful for new users exploring the tool.

## Solution Implemented
Added comprehensive Long help text (54 lines) to root command covering:

1. **Overview** - What goshi does and key principles
2. **Quick Start** - 4 main workflows:
   - Doctor: Environment health check
   - Config: Configuration management
   - FS: Safe filesystem operations
   - Heal: Automatic environment repairs
3. **Documentation** - How to access help
4. **Interactive Mode** - Running without arguments
5. **Environment Variables** - All GOSHI_* configuration options

## Tasks Completed
- ✅ Identified missing Long description in root command
- ✅ Created comprehensive help text with actionable examples
- ✅ Included all 4 primary workflows
- ✅ Documented interactive mode feature
- ✅ Listed environment variables for configuration
- ✅ Tested with `goshi --help` showing full Long description
- ✅ Committed changes with clear reference message
- ✅ Pushed to origin, merged to main, cleaned up branch

## Testing
- Rebuilt with `make build`
- Verified `goshi --help` displays full 54-line Long description
- Verified examples are clear and actionable
- Confirmed formatting and alignment correct
- No errors or regressions detected

## Impact
- New users now see comprehensive introduction on first help access
- All main workflows documented with examples
- Environment configuration options clearly visible
- Users guided to subcommand help for detailed information
- Improved overall CLI usability and discoverability
